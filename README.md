# YUE - Yes Users Exist

      Hi, I'm YUE. I'm a bot that helps with Discord-server management. I'm a work in progress, but I'm getting better every day. I'm quite modular
        and can be extended with new features. I'm written in Java and use the JDA library to interact with Discord. I'm currently being developed by a single person, but I'm open to contributions from others.
