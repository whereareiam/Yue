# YUE - Yes Users Exist

      Hi, I'm YUE. I'm a bot that helps with Discord-server management. I'm a work in progress, but I'm getting better every day. I'm quite modular
        and can be extended with new features. I'm written in Java and use the JDA library to interact with Discord. I'm currently being developed by a single person, but I'm open to contributions from others.

### Free-to-use plugins

- **[Essentials](https://github.com/aerittopia/YueEssentials)** - A set of basic commands and features that are
  essential for any Discord server.
- **[Verification](https://github.com/aerittopia/YueVerification)** - Adds verification for users when they first join
  the Discord server.

### How to use

> Currently, there is no How-to-use guide, because the bot is not yet ready for public use.
